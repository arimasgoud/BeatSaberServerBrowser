# Multiplayer Lobby Browser Mod for Beat Saber
âœ¨ **This is a modification for Beat Saber 1.12.2+ that adds a browser for custom multiplayer games.**

## How it works

### Hosting games
This mod, if enabled, shares your Server Code automatically, and lets users join with one click.

### Joining games
From the "Multiplayer" menu, press the new "Lobby Browser" button. You will now see a list of all custom party games that you can join.

## Installation
Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/roydejong/BeatSaberLobbyBrowserMod/releases) page, and extract it to your Beat Saber folder.

(If the mod was successfully installed, you will have `LobbyBrowserMod.dll` in your `Plugins` directory.)

### Requirements
These libraries are required, install them with ModAssistant if you don't have them yet.

- BSIPA ^4.1.3
- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage ^1.4.0
- SiraUtil ^1.4.0

### Recommended
ðŸ”¥ The lobby browser supports [MultiplayerExtensions](https://github.com/Zingabopp/MultiplayerExtensions), which lets you play custom maps! You can see which games are "modded" in the browser.
