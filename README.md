⚠ This is a test version, please try it out and report any issues. 

## Overview
- If you have this mod and host a game, you can share it in the Server Browser with a single switch.

### Joining games
After installing the mod, you can find the Server Browser in the Multiplayer menu.

From there, simply select a game and click Connect to join up.

### For hosts
To show your game in the server browser, you must have the mod installed. 

You can then make your game visible by flipping the switch under Gameplay Setup:

## Installation
Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/roydejong/BeatSaberServerBrowser/releases) page, and extract it to your Beat Saber folder.

*If the mod was successfully installed, you will see `ServerBrowser.dll` in your `Plugins` directory.*

### Requirements
These libraries are required, install them using ModAssistant if you don't have them yet (but you *probably* already do):

- BSIPA ^4.1.3
- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage ^1.4.0
- SongCore ^3.0.0

### Recommended
I **highly** recommend installing [MultiplayerExtensions](https://github.com/Zingabopp/MultiplayerExtensions), which lets you play custom maps in multiplayer! You can see which games are "modded" in the browser.
